                p
                  | TED was born in 1984 out of Richard Saul Wurman's observation of a powerful convergence among three fields: technology, entertainment and design. The first TED included a demo of the compact disc, the e-book and cutting-edge 3D graphics from Lucasfilm, while mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot demonstrated how to map coastlines using his developing theory of fractal geometry.

                  | TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics ‚Äî from science to business to global issues ‚Äî in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.

            h2 Our Mission: Spread ideas
            p
              | TED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. On TED.com, we're building a clearinghouse of free knowledge from the world's most inspired thinkers ‚Äî and a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other, both online and at TED and TEDx events around the world, all year long.
            p
              | AIn fact, everything we do ‚Äî from our Conferences to our TED Talks to the projects sparked by the TED Prize, from the global TEDx community to the TED-Ed lesson series ‚Äî is driven by this goal: How can we best spread great ideas?
            p
              | TED is owned by a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation. Our agenda is to make great ideas accessible and spark conversation.
